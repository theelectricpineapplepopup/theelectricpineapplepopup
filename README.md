# The Electric Pineapple Pop-up

![pina-watt](public/img/portfolio/pina.png)

The Electric Pineapple Pop-up proposes not a new commercial product
that would allow food to be effortlessly ingested as undifferentiated
energy -- something like today's Soylent -- but rather a playful
relationship between eater and eaten, a ruminative feedback loop
equipping the consumer to realize the Pineapple of her own unique
desires.*
